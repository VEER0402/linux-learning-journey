1. For creating any file **touch** command is use. eg **touch 1.txt**

1. **nano** is a test editor which can be used to edit or insert the text inside the file.

   to save and exit from this editor press **CTRL+X then Y**

1. to see what is inside the file we use **cat** command eg. cat 1.txt

1. For creating any file and immediate writing something the command is **nano 2.txt**(file name) this will allow to write in the file and make a file as well.

1. **rm **command is used to remove the any file from dir.
